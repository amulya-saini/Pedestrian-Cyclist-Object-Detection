# Pedestrian & Cyclist Detection

# Key Features:

**Multi-Object Detection:**
The implementation includes the detection of both pedestrians and cyclists, providing a versatile solution for scenarios involving various moving entities.

**OpenCV Integration:** 
Leveraging the powerful OpenCV library, the project seamlessly processes video frames, extracts relevant information, and annotates objects with bounding boxes.

**YOLO Integration:**
The YOLO model, specifically YOLOv3, is integrated for accurate and efficient object detection. The configuration files and weights are included for ease of use.

**Pre-Annotated Output:**
 The output video is pre-annotated with bounding boxes around detected objects, enabling easy visualization of the model's performance.
