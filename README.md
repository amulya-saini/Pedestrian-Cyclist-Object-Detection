# Pedestrian-Cyclist-Object-Detection
Welcome to my "Pedestrian-Cyclist-Object-Detection" GitHub project. I created this tool to detect pedestrians and cyclists in videos, simplifying my daily tasks as an RA who helped in image annotation at work. The project utilizes the YOLOv3 deep learning framework for efficient object detection.
